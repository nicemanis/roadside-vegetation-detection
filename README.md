# Detection of Roadside Vegetation

Detecting vegetation in robotics is used for:
- Navigating autonomous vehicles through on road and off road scenarios
- Detecting the weed nearby the railway
- Maintaining roadside infrastructure

# Methods
- Near Infrared images because chlorophyll rich vegetation reflects NIR light and having that part of the spectrum
makes the classification problem easier
- Visible part of the spectrum

# Input
- Still image or video stream

# Output
- Segmented area
